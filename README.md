# Knowledge Sharing

Welcome to my **Knowledge Sharing** repository.

This is where I share my knowledge about stuff that I learned, especially AI/ML, Data, and interviewing.

Each folder will comes with Jupyter Notebooks, in which I explain and demonstrate stuff with math and codes. All of them come from my personal knowledge and experience, so there may be some mistakes.
